The start of the new year brings with it the opportunity to reflect on our life experiences over the past tweleve months, evaluating our circumstances and setting new objectives to address any imbalances accordingly. This blog post is my attempt of doing just that to create a document that I can refer to as the year progresses to hold myself accountable to my objectives. Here it is, my 2026 list of objectives.

## Create a Healthier Work-Life Balance

In March 2024 I decided it was time to move on from my role as a Software Engineer at a large British asset manager in the heart of the City of London. I had been with the company since 2018, initally joining as an Industrial Placement Student then returning on the Technology Graduate Scheme in 2020, ultimatley as the years progressed I became a leading Software Engineer in a front-office technology team responsible for trading tools behind the Emerging Market equities desk. I truley couldn't have asked for a better place to start my career, I look back on the years spent with fondness, glad that I was able to start my career in a place enabling me to combine my interests in Finance and Technology, whilst building many friendships that still persist a year on from leaving the firm.

I was looking for a faster paced environment.
