The start of a new year is the perfect opportunity to reflect on the direction of our lives over the prior twelve months. It is a chance to evaluate our current circumstances and set objectives to address any imbalances accordingly.

This blog post is my attempt at doing just that. I have taken time to reflect on what I want to achieve this year and decided that writing it down in a document I can refer to as the year progresses is a great way to hold myself accountable to my objectives. With that in mind, here is my list of objectives for 2026.

## Create a Healthier Work-Life Balance

In 2024, I felt it was time to explore new opportunities and move on from my role as a Software Engineer at a large Asset Manager in the City of London. It was not an easy choice to make; I had spent six years with the company, having joined as an Industrial Placement Student experiencing their first _proper_ job. Over that time, I grew deeply familiar with the environment and felt a strong sense of comfort and loyalty to the firm.

Having decided to move on, I spent time defining what I truly wanted from my next role. Most importantly, I was looking for an environment that would challenge me; I didn't want a sense of comfort, being overly comfortable is not conducive to personal growth. I found that opportunity and began a new position in December of 2024.

From a professional perspective, the move has been incredibly fulfilling. At a relatively young age, I’ve been given the opportunity to lead the development of a key initiative and take on a significantly higher level of responsibility. As the first software engineer within the team, this naturally came with greater exposure and accountability. Over the past year, I’ve also gained my first experiences interviewing and hiring candidates as we expand the development team. I now work in a fast paced environment where I’m challenged frequently and learning every day. It is exactly the kind of role I was looking for when I made the decision to move on.

While my professional life has flourished, the increased intensity of the role, combined with longer working hours and a longer daily commute, has shifted the sense of balance I feel between my professional and personal life. On a typical weekday, I average around three hours of free time in the evenings, which I accept as part of the role. One area where this lifestyle change has had an impact is my personal fitness. Over the past year, I’ve been less consistent with the gym and martial arts training, and I move less during the day than I used to, leading to some weight gain. It is my responsibility to prioritise exercise and establish a better balance to maintain my health.

To address this, I will commit to working from home one day a week. This will eliminate two hours of commuting, allowing me to re-purpose that time for productive means such as training early in the morning without needing to wake up at unreasonably early hours, and attending martial arts classes in the evening without having to leave work early. On that day, I can maintain focus at work while also dedicating time to my personal hobbies.

I will continue to be in the office four days a week. On those days, I will commit to incorporating at least one form of exercise during lunch, whether attending the provided martial arts classes or using the gym, or alternatively taking a walk outside. I need to be more intentional and confident in taking that time to step away from work when it is appropriate to do so, recognising that I’ve been so absorbed in my work that I haven’t given myself the space to maintain my health and energy.

I hope this strategy will create a better balance, enabling me to pursue a rewarding professional career while continuing to enjoy the hobbies and activities that bring me joy and sustain my overall happiness.

## Moving Further Into London

For as long as I can remember I've lived in one of London's suburbs, travelling in and out of central and most recently west london for work. My total commute time is close to two hours per day. The time has come to move closer into London. Not only will this reduce my total travel time from around two hours to forty minuets helping to achieve the objective of creating a healhier work life balance, but also I have come to realise being further out comes with an opportunity cost. Living in the suburbs means I cannot have the sponteniety of my peers who live in central london. Whereas they can go with the flow on an spontaneous evening out, at 23:00 I have to begin thinking about how I'm going to get home, checking if the trains are running. For planned events I can always book a hotel, so this is fine. Its that spoentaniety that is the opportunity cost. Since my life revolves around being in London, with the majority of my friends there, it makes sense to be physically there where the action is.

## Completing Dry January

I am by no means a big drinker, but I do enjoy the odd pint with friends, family and collegues. Typically, at least one night during the week involves some form of alcohol. There is a catch though: it doesn't take many drinks over the course of an evening to wreck my next day. Even three pints over an evening can leave me feeling lathargic and less energetic, often being consumed by an overwhelimg desire to sleep the following day. Consuming small to moderate amounts of alcohol is all it takes makes me feel groggy, miserable and generally off, reducing my performance in all aspects of life. It is hard to operate at 100% when you feel that way.

As a result I've often flirted with the idea of abstaning from alcohol completley, managing a grand tweleve consequetive days without alcohol in 2025. It's shocking when you think that since aged 18 I haven't had more than tweleve consequetive days without alcohol, and while I didn't manage to completley rid alcohol from my life last year, I did reset my relationship with it to a certain extent, rarely exceeing three drinks in an evening when going out.

In 2024 I abstained from alcohol 56% of the days in the years. In 2025 I improved on this and increased it to 61%. The vast majority of this drinking in 2025 was sensible, typically being one or two pints, however, I still managed to waste almost 10% of my year in a state of hangover. I get such little free time that I cannot justify wasting another minute in a state of self-inflicted misery. So for this year I am fully commiting myself to Dry Janurary. It isn't a commitment to quit completley forever, but I am curious to complete a month without any alcohol and assess how I feel, with a view on extending into February if I find the benefits complelling enough to continue on.

What I want to get from it is consistency. Consistently being able to train in the morning before work, consistently having the energy to work on side projects and consistently performing at my peak in my professional work. Whenever I drink, that consistency is interrupted, I'm therefore interested to see what I can do after experiencing the compounding effects of daily clarity without alcohol interrupting me.

## Committing to Build in Public

I spend a large proportion of my free time building side projects. This habit has had huge benefits in terms of application to my professional work; developing technical skills outside of the workplace is a great way to learn in your own time, it is one of the main reasons my technical skills are where they are today.

The vast majority of these projects never see the light of day. Most often this is because I do not complete them, but the more important factor was the uncomfortable feeling I had sharing the things I have built online, and the fear I had of putting myself out there in the public domain. It is something I am still working to overcome. It wasn't until I read the book [Show Your Work]({{< relref "/book-notes/show-your-work.md" >}}) that my mindset began to change, making me understand that if your work isn't discoverable it might as well not exist, it has to be visible and nothing it to be gained by keeping what we have learnt to ourselves in isolation.

After reading that book I bought myself this domain and launched my personal blog, aiming to share my thoughts about any topic I found interesting, mainly around technology, programming and finance, making my first movements towards being comfortable putting myself in the public domain. This year I want to take this concept further and commit to building in public. If you're unfamiliar with the term, building in public is the practice of creating a project while openly sharing the progress, decisions, successes, and failures. Being transparent with the successes and failures, learning in public, and sharing milestones are all part of the process. I am to do this with the time I reclaim from my first objective.

2026 will be the year of the publically shared side project, and I look forward to showing the things I'm working in my free time on through this blog, my X account and potentially YouTube. I'm aiming to move from a consumer of content to a producer of it.

## Writing Book Summaries

I fill the daily commute by reading books. Typically I read for at least thirty minuets per day. Once I've finished a book that tends to be the end of my interaction with it. As a consequence, I'm left with a bunch of highlights on my kindle that I never look at again. I feel like that is wasting the information contained within, generally if I highlighted it, it must have resented with me in some aspect.

Therefore for each book that I have found interesting enough to complete, I will start to use this blog as a space to summarise the key takeways I have from the text, over time I aim to build a space which I can refer to, reminding myself of the key things I took from each book I have completed. This will be a way of retaining the information, whilst also sharing those take aways online. I guess this relates to a degree with the concept of building in public, not in the sense of building something technically, but building a collection of extracts I find useful.

## Priortising Sleep

I spend my day's chronically tired.
want at least a full 7 hours sleep each night.
prioritise sleep hygine, off of phones / screens by around 10:30.
no doomscrolling.
combined wiht no alcohol want to feel more energised.

## 1 Second Everyday

One second everyday is a application which you record a one second video.

first introduced by my friend james while at uni. he has almost 10 years of his life in 1 second clips. great to be able to look back at your life like that. stared in the past and stopped. determined to complete a year this time.
