Today's world is dominated by technology that diminishes our ability to focus, distracting us from the task at hand. We all carry devices loaded with applications that have the sole objective of consuming our most precious and finite resources: our time, energy and focus. Humanity has lost the ability to concentrate for long durations of time interrupted, to work through difficult and tedious problems, reaching instead for smartphone and the instant gratification it provides.

Occassionally, a device comes to market that offers an antidote to these disturbances. Such devices are limited in scope, functionality and purpose. The most compelling asset of such a device is its simplicity, creating a distraction free environment that encourages deep work. I own two such devices that embody the *intentional device*. The first being my [Kindle](https://amzn.to/3IE40Wn) - an intentional, distraction free reading device. The second is my [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2) - a minimal and distraction free writing experience that provides the space to think, explore ideas and create. 

The Remarkable 2 is not feature rich. It has no browser, no app store, and no colour. It is a digital notepad an no more, that is precicely what makes it such a joy to use. Whereas other devices distract me from my task, the Remarkable enhances my focus. Perhaps the greatest benefit to me has been to shift my mindset and habits from one of consuming, to one of producing. I now activley enjoy the process of coming home from work to write, and there is something about the process of writing with the hand that connects you to your thoughts on a deeper level that typing can.

It is for these reasons, that when the Remarkable team announced the launch their newest model, the Paper Pro Move, I immediatley placed an order. Why, when I already have the Remarkable 2 you may ask. Well - my daily commute to work sees me travelling for two hours per day. In that time, I typically read on my Kindle; it is small, can be used with one hand and is practical to use on the commute. At times, I want to write down my thoughts or take some detailed notes on the book I am currently reading and although I have the Remarkable 2 in my bag, using it on a crowded train is too un-weidly and impractical. In essense, I saw in the Paper Pro Move a device that could combine the Remarkable 2 and kindle together, providing a small form factor in which I could read books and take detailed notes on the go. 

After experiencing the Remarkable 2, I had high hopes for the Move. I quickly came to realise however, that while the device has potential, it has some flaws that prevent me from enjoying the experience as I do with the Remarkable 2. Unfortunatley, after two weeks with the device I have decided that I will be returning it. 

### The Battery Life

Remarkable advertises the Move to have a battery life that [lasts for up to two weeks.](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move) In my experience with the device, this is misleading and un-realistic. I typically get four to five hours of usage out of the Remarkable Move. In stand-by the power draw is minimal and does not train. However, once used it drains quickly; I have found the battery to drop by as much as 10% in half an hour of usage. The battery drain has been dreadful - more aligned to my iPhone than to my other e-ink devices. I primarily read e-pub files and take notes, with the front-light off and the Wi-Fi disabled. 

I'm used to e-ink devices having great battery life, my previously mentioned 2016 8th Generation Kindle still posts an impressive battery life even after approaching almost a decade of usage, only needing a charge roughly once every couple of weeks. The Remarkable 2 has great battery life, typically lasting me around two weeks between charges - given the marketing and the previously fantastic experience with the Remarkable 2 device, I was expecting similar results with the Move. 

For a premium device that has cost Â£439 in total with the case, I find this un-acceptable, especially since the device is designed to be on the go, where you may not have access to a charger such as a long coach or plane journey. In this aspect I feel the team have over-promised and under delivered. 

### E-Reader Performance

The move's form factor should lend itself to being a good e-reading device. The experience reading on the device is OK, but certainly not great. 

Page navigation is sluggish and sometimes un-responsive, requring multiple gestures to successfully get the page to turn. Unlike the Kindle, once an annotation or highlight is made onto the text, you can not adjust the font size or formatting. Doing so causes the annotations to stay in the place they previously were; they do not move with the text. Changing font size itself is sluggish, with the entire document having to re-process. Navigating through a e-pub isn't seemless, there's no means to quick scroll across the document as there is with the Kindle. 

I find the experience reading on the Kindle far more pleasant. Given the execellent battery life on the Kindle, I have no battery anxiety either, and can be condifent the device will last until I reach the destination. 

### The Size

The Kindle is generally pocketable. the move fits into my Jacket pocket, which I often wear given I live in London. On warmer days however, without a jacket, you will need a small bag or backpack to carry the Move; the additional hight of the Move makes it stick out of any pocket. If I'd have to carry a bag, I could just take the Remarkable 2. 

### The Subscription 

Given the price of the device, the subscription model to access cloud features leaves me with a sour taste. Files stop syncing after 50 days of usage. This doesn't sit well with me; I feel they should offer an Apple like model with free limited storage, and offer a subscription model to increase the storage. 

### Colour Isn't Necessary

The colour feels like a gimmick. I tend to write in black ink all the time as it avoids the additional refreshes that tend to occur when using colour. I feel the device would function fine as a greyscale device; I've never wanted colour when using the Remarkable 2. The display has a grey colour. The yellow ghosting effect before the refresh is complete. 


### The Writing Experience 

I prefer the writing experience on the Remarkable 2. The additional space tends to improve productivity, as opposed to trying to cram notes into the smaller screen. It feels as though the Move is designed to be a companion device rather than a stand-alone offering. Compared to the RM2, the Move's screen feels spippery to write on. It doesn't have that pencil on paper like feel, I am aware I'm writing on a glass panel. 

In summary I had high hopes for the Move, envisaging a device that could combine my Remarkable 2 and Kindle together into a smaller portable package. I am left with a device that isn't quite as good as either stand-alone device. For reading, I prefer using the dedicated Kindle, and for writing I prefer the experience on the Remarkable 2; the intentionality of sitting at a desk to write, rather than trying to write on a busy commuter train.
