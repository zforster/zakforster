### Purchase Rationale

Today's world is dominated by technology that diminishes our ability to focus, distracting us from the task at hand. Our devices are loaded with applications that have the sole objective of consuming our most precious and finite resources: our time, energy and attention. The ability to apply oneself to difficult and tedious problems with the required intensity has been lost, instead we reach for smartphone and the instant gratification it provides.

Occassionally, a device comes to market that is restricted in scope, functionality and purpose, offering an antidote to such disturbances. Far from being a disadvantage to the consumer, the simplicity of these **intentional devices** are in fact a virtue, a compelling asset that contributes to a distraction free environment and deep work.

The [reMarkable 2 (RM2)](https://reMarkable.com/products/reMarkable-2) is one such product. It is not feature rich, has no browser, no app store, and no colour display. It is a digital notepad an nothing more. That is precicely what makes it a joy to use. Since using the RM2 I have developed a propensity to produce content instead of consume it; I now look forward to taking time out of my day to write and develop ideas, the clarity of thought being enhanced by using a device as limited as the RM2 is.

For these reasons, when reMarkable announced the launch of the Paper Pro Move, I immediatley placed an order. I eagerly awaited having a modern device that could replace my decade old Kindle, the reMarkable Move seemingly being the perfect device to combine the writing experience of the RM2 with the reading capability and portability of the Kindle. I have the RM2 with me in my bag on a daily basis, but have found using it on a crowded train is impractical. With the Move however, I would now have a space to read, take detailed notes and explore ideas on the go.

After using the Move, I conclude that while the device has potential, it does not fufil the niche use case I had in mind. I will be taking advantage of the generous returns policy reMarkable offers. Here's why.

### The Battery

reMarkable's advertisements claim that the Move has a battery life that [lasts for up to two weeks.](https://reMarkable.com/products/reMarkable-paper/pro-move) In my experience, this claim is misleading. I typically get four to five hours of aggregate use on the device. Therefore, three to four days is the more realistic battery life for my pattern of use. This does seem to be a common issue, many users within the [r/reMarkable](https://www.reddit.com/r/reMarkableTablet/) subreddit have reported similarly abismal battery performance. When reading an e-pub, with the wifi and backloght off, the battery has drained by as much as 10% within half an hour of use. This has been surprising, the battery being more akin to a smartphone than that of other e-ink devices. The Move performs worse than either my reMarkable 2, or Kindle.

Being a premium device, I was expecting more from the battery life, which I find contradictory with reMarkable's messaging that the Move is designed for on the go note taking away from an external power source. I'm not confident it would last a long coach or plane journey. I hope this is a teething issue that can be rectified by software updates, but so far reMarkable have said nothing on the issue.

### E-Reading Experience

I had considered the Move could become my main e-reader. Having a place not only to read, but also to take notes and digest the material wherever I go was appealing. While you can read on the Move, it certainly does not rival the experience of using a dedicated e-reading device such as a Kindle.

When compared to the Kindle, page navigation is un-responsive, sometimes requring multiple gestures to ensure the page turns successfully. Once an annotation or highlight has been made, you can not adjust the formatting as the written material stays in place. Changing the font size or document formatting is sluggish as the entire document has to re-process which takes time to complete. Additionally writing with the marker and using the device on the go are contractictory actions. Writing is more plesant when stationary at a desk. Trying to use a marke to highlight or take notes within a commuter environment isn't practical. I much prefer highlighting and note taking on the Kindle. 

Steve Jobs was certainly onto something when at the original iPhone launch event he said:
> who wants a stylus, you have to get them and out them away. Then you lose them. Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus.

If you are looking for a hybrid reading and writing device, this isn't it. I have since returned to using the Kindle. 

### The Size

The Move is an awkward size, too large to fit in a pocket but too small for productive work. Since it requires a bag I could just as easily bring the larger reMarkable 2 on my journey. Unless you have deep pockets, the Move can feel just as burdensome to take on the go as its larger sibling does.

The uncovnentional aspect ratio makes it difficult to read PDFs in portrait move. An option is to use landscape, this requires more frequent scrolling, leading to yellowish artifacts on the screen and an even faster drain of the battery.

### The Subscription Model

ReMarkable's cloud services are fantastic; syncing is seeemless and the mobile and desktop applications are superb. However, given the cost of the device, charging for basic functionality leaves a sour taste, espeically when considering competitors such as Supernote are not charging for their cloud services. I would like to see ReMarkable offer full functionality with a limited storage capacity, followed by various paid tiers depending on the storage requirements you have.

### Colour Isn't Necessary

The Move uses the Gallery 3 panel for its display providing the ability to use colour. The display seems un-ready for use in a consumer product. In use, it continously flashes as you navigate, scroll or write. Yellow artifacts are common, especially when scrolling, and it takes time represent the image correctly. I avoid the use of colour on the device to avoid these artifacts. Colour is more of a novetly. The lack of colour in the reMarkable 2 is preferabl; the display is more stable and does not suffer from the same level of artifacts.

Given the purpose of the device is to take quick notes on go, I question if colour is necessary.

### The Writing Experience

In comparison to the reMarkable 2, the newer activ marker pen feels more like writing with a slippery plastic nib. In general, I have a preference for the writing experience on the reMarkable 2. The additional screen size tends to improve productivity, as opposed to trying to cram notes onto the smaller screen. The Move seems to be designed as a companion device rather than a stand-alone offering; a place to jot a quick note or thought in the moment, for later expansion on a computer or largeer screened reMarkable. In a situation where I want to do deep work, I wouldn't use the Move.

## Summary

I had envisaged the Move being a device that could combine the best of the reMarkable 2 and Kindle together into a smaller portable package. In reality, it isn't as good as either device. For reading, the Kindle and its ecosystem is far superior, and for writing I prefer the experience on the reMarkable 2. When using the Move I realised writing is an intentional task, something best associated with sitting at a desk, not a busy commuter environment. Therefore, I will stick to reading on the Kindle, and writing on the RM2. 

The Move is a confused device, designed to be used on the go, with a battery life more suited to a desk environment with immediate access to a charger, it is too large to carry in a pocket, with a screen too small to be used for serious productivity. The Move is a device that over promises and under delivers. It is for these reasons that I am returning the device.
