Today's world is dominated by technology that distracts us from the task at hand and diminishes our focus. No matter where we are, or what we are doing, all of us carry with us devices loaded with apps that have the sole objective of taking out most precious and finite resources from us; our time, energy and focus. Humanity is collectivley losing the ability to focus for long durations, or to work through longer term problems and enjoy the process of completing something difficult and tedious, reaching instead for smartphone and the instant gratification it provides.

Occassionally a device comes to market that offers an antidote to these distractions. Such devices are typically limited in scope and purpose, their limitations in fact being their most compelling asset. The restrictiveness and intentionality of the device allows only for focus on the task at hand. I own a small number of devices that fall under the intentional device criteria, most notably, my [Kindle](https://amzn.to/3IE40Wn) - an intentional distraction free reading device, and my [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2) - a minimal and distract free writing experience the provides a space to simply think and explore ideas.

The intentionality and limitations of the Remarkable 2 is precicely why I enjoy using it so much. Other devices distract me from my task, the Remarkable provides a space to focus and encourages creativity and expression. There's something about writing with the hand that connects you with your thoughts more than a keyboard does (reinforcement). Using the device has helped shift my mindset from one of consuming, to one of producing; for instance, many of the blog posts on this site having been drafted through the Remarkable.

It is for this reason, that when the Remarkable team announced the launch of the Paper Pro Move, I immediatley decided to place an order and purchase the device. I commute to work in London for two hours in total per day. In that time I typically read on my 8th Generation Kindle; it is small, can be used with one hand and generally is practical to use on the commute. Sometimes in that commute, I want to write down my thoughts or take some detailed notes on the book I am currently reading. Although I have the Remarkable 2 with me in my bag, in practise using it on a crowded train is too un-weidly and impractical for that environment. In essense, when I saw the Paper Pro Move, I sae a device that could potentially combine my Remarkable 2 and my kindle together - a small form factor in which I could read books and take detailed notes on the go. Yes, the price was high, but I felt the value in terms of potential content produced and knowledge absorbed from the books read would far outsize the initial cost.
