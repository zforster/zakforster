### Purchase Rationale

Today's world is dominated by technology that diminishes our ability to focus, distracting us from the task at hand. Our devices are loaded with applications that have the sole objective of consuming our most precious and finite resources: our time, energy and attention. Humanity has lost the ability to apply itself to difficult and tedious problems with the required intensity, reaching instead for smartphone and the instant gratification it provides.

Occassionally, a device comes to market that is restricted in scope, functionality and purpose, offering an antidote to such disturbances. Far from being a disadvantage to the consumer, the simplicity of these **intentional devices** are in fact a virtue, a compelling asset that contributes to a distraction free environment - encouraging deep work and unintruded thought.

The [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2) is one such product. It is not feature rich, has no browser, no app store, and no colour display. It is a digital notepad an nothing more. That is precicely what makes it a joy to use. Whereas other devices are a distraction, the Remarkable 2 enhances my focus. In fact, since using the Remarkable I have developed a propensity to produce instead of consume content; I now look forward to taking time out of my day to write and develop ideas. An unexpected factor is how writing with the hand has taken on an almost theraputic quality, something typing on a keyboard could never parallel.

For these reasons, when Remarkable announced the launch of the Paper Pro Move, I immediatley placed an order. My rationale being that during the daily commute to work, I typically read on the Kindle. The small form factor provides convienence in a busy commuter environment. At times however, during the commute I want to write down thoughts or take detailed notes on the book I am currently reading. Although I have the Remarkable 2 in my bag, using it on a crowded train is impractical. The Paper Pro Move seemed to be the perfect device to fill this niche use case, combining the writing experience of the RM2 with a smaller, portable form factor like the Kindle, providing a place to read, take detailed notes and explore ideas on the go.

After spending time with the Move, I concluded that while the device has potential, it does not fufil the niche use case I had in mind. Unfortunatley, after a month with the device I have decided that I will be taking advantage of the generous returns policy Remarkable offers and return it. The following details my reasons.

### The Battery...

Remarkable's advertisements claim that the Move has a battery life that [lasts for up to two weeks.](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move) In my experience, this claim is misleading. I typically get four to five hours of total use with the Move. I have found the battery to drop by as much as 10% within half an hour of use - I had been using the device to read and take notes in black ink, with the WiFi disabled and backlight off. The battery drain is more aligned to my iPhone than to other e-ink devices.

Other e-ink devices I have used have great battery life, my afformentioned Kindle still posts an impressive battery life after almost a decade of use, only needing a charge once every one to two weeks depending on usage, far outperforming the Move. The Remarkable 2 has great battery life, easily lasting a week between charges despite daily usage. I was expecting similar results with the Move.

The Move is a premium device with a premium price tag - at this price range I find the battery life un-acceptable. For a device designed to be used on the go, I'm not confident it would last a long coach or plane journey. It is my hope that this is a teething issue that can be ironed out by software updates, we shall see.

### E-Reader Performance

In the Move, I had hoped for a device that could become my main e-reader, I was looking to take detailed notes on teh books I read. The Move does an OK job at being an e-reader, but certainly nothing move.

In comparison to my Kindle, page navigation is rather un-responsive, sometimes requring multiple gestures to ensure the page turns successfully. Once an annotation or highlight is made onto the text, you can not adjust the font size or formatting as the annotations stay in place, not moving with the text. Changing font size or formatting is also sluggish, the entire document has to re-process which takes time to complete.

The Kindle is a dedicated reading device, it is no suprise that I find the experience reading on the Kindle far more pleasant. Using the pen to highlight text when standing or moving in impractical, Steve Jobs was correct to dislike the idea of the stylus. If you are looking for a hybrid reading and writing device, this isn't it. I have since returned to using the Kindle. Additionally, given the execellent battery life on the Kindle, I can be condifent the device will last until I reach my destination.

### The Size

The sizing of the Move is awkward - too large to fit in a trouser pocket, therefore requiring a large jacket pocket, or bag to transport it in. Since it requires a bag I could just as easily bring the larger Remarkable 2 on my journey. Again, when comparing to the Kindle, which generally fits into the majority of my trouser pockets, the Move can feel just as burdensome to take on the go as its larger sibling does.

The additional height and uncovnentional aspect ratio leads to PDFs being difficult to read in portrait move. You can use landscape, but this requires the use of scrolling, meaning more strange flashes on the screen as it refreshes and an even faster drain of the battery.

### The Subscription

I can understand why Remarkable charges for the cloud services it provides; syncing is seeemless, the mobile and desktop applications are superb. However, given the cost of the device, charging for something as basic as maintaining the ability to sync older documents that haven't been used in 50 days leaves a sour taste, espeically when considering that competitors such as Supernote are not charging for their services. I would like to see the Remarkable team follow an iCloud like offering, with a free tier, followed by various paid tiers depending on the storage requirements you have.

### Colour Isn't Necessary

The Remarkable Move uses the Gallery 3 panel for its display, which offers customers the ability to use colour. The display seems un-ready for use in a consumer product - in use, it seems to continously blink and flash at you as you navigate, scroll or write, yellow artifacts are common, and it takes time to settle to represent the image correctly. I tend to avoid the use of colour on the device to avoid these artifacts - colour is more of a novetly, the lack of colour in the Remarkable 2 is something I prefer, the display being more stable and enjoyable to use, not suffering from the same artifacts, and completing refreshes quickly.

Given the purpose of the device, to take notes on the move I question if colour is necessary - a black and white version of the Move with a lower price and more performant battery is something I would take over this iteration of the Move.

### The Writing Experience

I have a preference for the writing experience on the Remarkable 2. The additional screen size tends to improve productivity, as opposed to trying to cram notes onto the smaller screen. The Move seems to be designed as a companion device rather than a stand-alone offering; a place to jot a quick note or thought in the moment, for later expansion on a computer or largeer screened Remarkable. In a situation where I want to do deep work, I wouldn't use the Move.

## Summary

I had high hopes for the Move, envisaging a device that could combine the best of the Remarkable 2 and Kindle together into a smaller portable package. In reality, it isn't quite as good as either as stand-alone device. For reading, the Kindle and its ecosystem is far superior, and for writing I prefer the experience on the Remarkable 2 an the associated intentionality of sitting at a desk to write, rather than trying to write on a busy commuter train.

The Move is a confused device, designed to be used on the go, with a battery life more suited to a desk environment with immediate access to a charger, it is too large to carry in a pocket, with a screen too small to be used for serious productivity. Through their clever advertising, in my opinion, the Move is a device that has over promises and under delivers. It is for these reasons that I am returning the device.
