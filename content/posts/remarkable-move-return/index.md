Today's world is dominated by technology that diminishes our ability to focus, distracting us from the task at hand. We all carry devices loaded with applications that have the sole objective of consuming our most precious and finite resources: our time, energy and focus. Humanity has lost the ability to concentrate for long durations of time interrupted, to work through difficult and tedious problems, reaching instead for smartphone and the instant gratification it provides.

Occassionally, a device comes to market that offers an antidote to these disturbances. Such devices are limited in scope, functionality and purpose. The most compelling asset of such a device is its simplicity, creating a distraction free environment that encourages deep work. I own two such devices that embody the *intentional device*. The first being my [Kindle](https://amzn.to/3IE40Wn) - an intentional, distraction free reading device. The second is my [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2) - a minimal and distraction free writing experience that provides the space to think, explore ideas and create. 

The Remarkable 2 is not feature rich. It has no browser, no app store, and no colour. It is a digital notepad an no more, that is precicely what makes it such a joy to use. Whereas other devices distract me from my task, the Remarkable enhances my focus. Perhaps the greatest benefit to me has been to shift my mindset and habits from one of consuming, to one of producing. I now activley enjoy the process of coming home from work to write, and there is something about the process of writing with the hand that connects you to your thoughts on a deeper level that typing can.

It is for these reasons, that when the Remarkable team announced the launch their newest model, the Paper Pro Move, I immediatley placed an order. Why, when I already have the Remarkable 2 you may ask. Well - my daily commute to work sees me travelling for two hours per day. In that time, I typically read on my Kindle; it is small, can be used with one hand and is practical to use on the commute. At times, I want to write down my thoughts or take some detailed notes on the book I am currently reading and although I have the Remarkable 2 in my bag, using it on a crowded train is too un-weidly and impractical. In essense, I saw in the Paper Pro Move a device that could combine the Remarkable 2 and kindle together, providing a small form factor in which I could read books and take detailed notes on the go. 

After experiencing the Remarkable 2, I had high hopes for the Move. I quickly came to realise however, that while the device has potential, it has some flaws that prevent me from enjoying the experience as I do with the Remarkable 2. Unfortunatley, after two weeks with the device I have decided that I will be returning it. 

### The Battery Life

Remarkable advertises the Move to have a battery life that [lasts for up to two weeks.](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move) In my experience with the device, this claim is misleading and un-realistic. I typically get four to five hours of active use out of the Move. I have found the battery to drop by as much as 10% within half an hour of use - I had been using the device to read and take notes in black ink, with the WiFi disabled and backlight off. The battery drain is more aligned to my iPhone than to other e-ink devices.

Other e-ink devices I have used have great battery life, my afformentioned Kindle still posts an impressive battery life after almost a decade of use, only needing a charge once every one to two weeks depending on usage, far outperforming the Move. The Remarkable 2 has great battery life, easily lasting a week between charges despite daily usage. I was expecting similar results with the Move.

The Move is a premium device with a premium price tag - at this price range I find the battery life un-acceptable. For a device designed to be used on the go, I'm not confident it would last a long coach or plane journey. It is my hope that this is a teething issue that can be ironed out by software updates, we shall see. 

### E-Reader Performance

In the Move, I had hoped for a device that could become my main e-reader, I was looking to take detailed notes on teh books I read. The Move does an OK job at being an e-reader, but certainly nothing move.

In comparison to my Kindle, page navigation is rather un-responsive, sometimes requring multiple gestures to ensure the page turns successfully. Once an annotation or highlight is made onto the text, you can not adjust the font size or formatting as the annotations stay in place, not moving with the text. Changing font size or formatting is also sluggish, the entire document has to re-process which takes time to complete. 

The Kindle is a dedicated reading device, it is no suprise that I find the experience reading on the Kindle far more pleasant. Using the pen to highlight text when standing or moving in impractical, Steve Jobs was correct to dislike the idea of the stylus. If you are looking for a hybrid reading and writing device, this isn't it. I have since returned to using the Kindle. Additionally, given the execellent battery life on the Kindle, I can be condifent the device will last until I reach my destination. 

### The Size

The sizing of the Move is awkward - too large to fit in a trouser pocket, therefore requiring a large jacket pocket, or bag to transport it in. Since it requires a bag I could just as easily bring the larger Remarkable 2 on my journey. Again, when comparing to the Kindle, which generally fits into the majority of my trouser pockets, the Move can feel just as burdensome to take on the go as its larger sibling does.

The additional height and uncovnentional aspect ratio leads to PDFs being difficult to read in portrait move. You can use landscape, but this requires the use of scrolling, meaning more strange flashes on the screen as it refreshes and an even faster drain of the battery.

### The Subscription 

I can understand why Remarkable charges for the cloud services it provides; syncing is seeemless, the mobile and desktop applications are superb. However, given the cost of the device, charging for something as basic as maintaining the ability to sync older documents that haven't been used in 50 days leaves a sour taste, espeically when considering that competitors such as Supernote are not charging for their services. I would like to see the Remarkable team follow an iCloud like offering, with a free tier, followed by various paid tiers depending on the storage requirements you have. 

### Colour Isn't Necessary

The Remarkable Move uses the Gallery 3 panel for its display, which offers customers the ability to use colour. The display seems un-ready for use in a consumer product - in use, it seems to continously blink and flash at you as you navigate, scroll or write, yellow artifacts are common, and it takes time to settle to represent the image correctly. I tend to avoid the use of colour on the device to avoid these artifacts - colour is more of a novetly, the lack of colour in the Remarkable 2 is something I prefer, the display being more stable and enjoyable to use, not suffering from the same artifacts, and completing refreshes quickly.

Given the purpose of the device, to take notes on the move I question if colour is necessary - a black and white version of the Move with a lower price and more performant battery is something I would take over this iteration of the Move.

### The Writing Experience 

I have a preference for the writing experience on the Remarkable 2. The additional screen size tends to improve productivity, as opposed to trying to cram notes onto the smaller screen. The Move seems to be designed as a companion device rather than a stand-alone offering; a place to jot a quick note or thought in the moment, for later expansion on a computer or largeer screened Remarkable. In a situation where I want to do deep work, I wouldn't use the Move. 

## Summary

I had high hopes for the Move, envisaging a device that could combine the best of the Remarkable 2 and Kindle together into a smaller portable package. In reality, it isn't quite as good as either as stand-alone device. For reading, the Kindle and its ecosystem is far superior, and for writing I prefer the experience on the Remarkable 2 an the associated intentionality of sitting at a desk to write, rather than trying to write on a busy commuter train. 

The Move is a confused device, designed to be used on the go, with a battery life more suited to a desk environment with immediate access to a charger, it is too large to carry in a pocket, with a screen too small to be used for serious productivity. Through their clever advertising, in my opinion, the Move is a device that has over promises and under delivers. It is for these reasons that I am returning the device.
