When it comes to the wristwatch I'm something of a puritan. Ever since my earliest teenage years I've always worn a traditional mechanical or quartz watch, and dismissed the smartwatch as an unnecessary and intrusive gimmick, a perception I've held right up to the later half of my twenties.

This interest in watches started with my old Seiko Sports 150 Kenetic dating from 1994. It was originally my dads and was gifted to me by him when I was thirteen or fourteen. I wore it all throughout my school and university years. It was with me for a lot of life's firsts, and for that, combined with the association to my dad it holds a lot of sentimental value. It is still with me today, albeit in much need of a service after thirty years of use without so much as a capacitor change. It will still be with me tomorrow, next year and the next ten years. Once serviced it will be just as functional and relevant as it was on the day it was bought.

There's a great advertisement campaign by the watch maker Patek Phillipe called the generations campaign. https://www.patek.com/en/manufacture/inside-patek-philippe/the-generations-campaign. It's key punchline is 'You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.'. That for me summarises what a traditional watch represents. The traditional mechanical watch is the antithesis of modern disposable consumer culture. While it is true that the cogs and gears that form a watches' movement are an obsolete relic from a by-gone pre-digital age, they still retain their functionally; a good mechanical watch can be kept running indefinatley, and over time each dent and scratch imprinted onto its case comes to represent a life well lived, eventually it will go to its next owner for them to add their story. There's something very pure about that.

Bringing the smartwatch into the conversation, with its yearly release cycles and planned obsolesence, you can't help but feel awareness that you're using a product that lacks longevity and is destined to become e-waste in a landfill once support is dropped. In that sense, partaking in the smart watch felt unpure.

But then it happened, my brother bought an Apple watch and showed me some of the sleep tracking functionalit... then I bought one too. Since buying and using it I have come to realise that both the traditional watch, and the smart watch occupy different niches within my life. They can therefore co-exist in harmony, with each having a place in the watch rotation.

The primary reason I bought the Apple watch was for its sleep tracking abilities. I'm generally someone who is chronically tired. I always fall asleep easily, and at the weekends, I myself taking a brief nap. Ultimatley I think this is because I simply do not sleep for a sufficiently long enough duration. I therefore wake up feeling tired the next day. I go to bed fairly late, I get up early and work fairly lengthy hours.

I felt the Apple watches' sleep tracking and scoring functionality could help me make more informed decisions around my sleep, having a clear objective of attemptinng to improve my sleep score. The Apple watch uses three main metrics to inform your sleep score. These are duration of your sleep, the consistency of your bed time, and the total interruptions you had during your sleep.

So far I certainly feel it is helping; the sleep tracking brings observable quanitfyable insight as to your sleeping habits. The act of observing how you are sleeping, makes you much more concious of your sleeping habits. The major way this has altered my sleep habits is to have a more consistent evening routine; consistency of bed time is one of the metrics used to score your sleep. By optimising the score, you begin to create consistency in your evening habits, making your patterns more regular. This has helped me to create healtheir sleep habits by having a proper wind down time in nthe evening, so that when 23:30 comes my body is in a relaxed enough state to drift off to sleep for the night.

I also like how in comparison to something like the Whoop which I was also considering, there is no subscription fee needed with the Apple watch. It's a one time purchase, you buy it and then use it, with no repeat fee to use the sleep tracking abilities.
