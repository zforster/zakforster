+++

At the start of the year, I set myself the objective of completing _Dry January_, the modern phenomenon of abstaining from alcohol for the entire month of January. I did this for a variety of reasons, primarily out of curiosity, to see if I experienced the multitude of benefits many who live an alcohol free lifestyle share online: improved energy levels, better sleep, enhanced mental clarity and consistency of output. As I write this it is the 1st of February 2026, and I have successfully completed the 31 days alcohol free. In this blog, I want to reflect on my experiences over the month and share my renewed perspective on alcohol and its impacts.

### Reasons for Doing Dry January

#### Evolving Lifestyle and Drinking Habits

Over recent years, as I've hit my mid-to-late twenties, the volume of alcohol I consume has naturally declined. Alcohol simply isn't a big part of my lifestyle. Changing circumstances, primarily driven by positive trends in my career, with associated longer working hours places constraints on the amount of free time I now have. As a result, I place far greater importance and value on the limited free time that I do have, and chose selectivley how to spend it. I want to protect my free time and have no interest spending it in a state of self inflicted misery caused by too many drinks the previous evening.

These evolving lifestyle trends and habits have meant that in recent times, when I have opted to drink, I typically wouldn't exceed three drinks, or simply chose to drink the alcohol free options. Of course there were exceptions to that rule where I would let loose, but entering into 2026, I was already in a place where I could quite happily go without any alcohol on an evening out.

It therefore seemed a natural progression, and a relativley easy one, to commit to cut it out completley for the month, with the goal of evaluating if it was something I wanted to continue on past Janurary (spoiler, it is).

#### Prioritising Energy and Focus

I recently read 50 Cent's Book [Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter](https://amzn.to/4bpsz5o). I was suprised to learn that despite his public persona, 50 Cent largely abstains from alcohol and other vices. Instead he gets his energy from working out and living a clean lifestyle. He states that living this clean lifestyle provides him with the energy to perform consistently, never missing an opportunity because of alcohol consumption the previous night.

This is something that resonates with me, particuarly as I suffer badly after consuming relativley small volumes of alcohol. Beyond the three drink mark, I seriously degrade the following day. I'm groggy, un-energetic, irritable, lathargic and generally in a miserable state. The quality of my training is reduced. The lack of sleep causes me to eat poor quality, highly calorific foods. My focus and mental capacity becomes lackluster, diminishing my ability to tackle problems with energy, creativity and concentration.

Feeling this way makes it impossible for me to operate at my maximum potential. I have come to realise that the cost of drinking goes beyond the monetary value spent on purchasing the drinks. There's a wider opportunity cost caused by the performance lag.

#### Questioning Societal Norms

In Britain, we have a particuarly unhealthy relationship with alcohol. We have a huge binge drinking culture, and as a nation we drink to excess. Unbeknownst to me, our ability to collectivley consume large volumes of poision is seen as a point of national pride. Growing up in the UK, going out with the sole objective of getting as trashed as you can is a rite of passage. It is so engrained in the culture, that not taking part is very difficult to do, especially for a young and impressionable person who's very sensitive to the opinions of their peers. Going against the grain singels you out as an oddity, which is an uncomfortable feeling. Following the trends of the tribe is deeply engrained in our nature through evolutionary pressures.

On top of the pressure to drink that comes from being within a group of peers all doing so, we also have cultural programming to contend with. This conditioning further reinforces the messaging that alcohol consumption is normal, and a required item for a whole range of events.

After reading Clear, I began to see alcohol advertisement in a new light. Look at any advertisement for an alcoholic drink. In almost all cases, the alcoholic drink is at the center of some event taking place on a scenic beach or colourful city, filled with smiling and happy people having a great time socialising with eachother. They sell the idea that drinking is literally the central pivotal thing that binds people together in a social setting, projecting the image that you can't posibbly talk to your friends without having a drink.

</div>

_Ads from Corona and Guinness, both selling the idea that drinking is central to a good time with friends._

The more I see these ads, the more they being to irritate me. They're not telling the full story. I feel I have a unique perspective here as I live opposite a pub and I can confidently say based on that experience that when people drink to excess, they become stupid. They do things they wouldn't normally do if they were not under the influence of alcohol. They become loud, impulsive, anti-social and annoying to be around to the sober individual. They get into fights and arguments that they wouldn't have gotten into without the alcohol to the detriment of the public services that have to come clean up the mess.

I guess you could say that by taking part in Dry Jan, was my way of rebelling against this societal norm.

### What I Gained Going Alcohol Free

#### Improved Energy Levels

Not drinking enhanced my energy levels. When I was drinking, it wouldn't be uncommon for me to take a nap in the evening after work, or in the mid-afternoon on a weekend. I never thought much of this, putting it down to the fact I just needed a little bit more rest than the rest of us.

After going alcohol free, I now realise that the root of this problem was in fact a knock on effect from the evenings I did have a drink. Alcohol is very detremental to sleep. It is particuarly ruthless against your restorative REM sleep. So in all likelihood, my napping requirements was most likely my bodies attempt to catch up on lost, or poor quality sleep.

My natural energy levels are much higher post going alcohol free, very rarley have I felt the need for a nap over this month. I put this down to having more restorative and deeper sleep, with full amounts of REM sleep now that the interrupting mechanisms of alcohol are gone.

#### True Confidence

For all the criticisms I have levied towards alcohol throughout this article, I do feel alcohol serves a perfectly legitimate purpose within social settings. My theory is that groups of individuals gravitate towards consuming alcoholic drinks together as a form of mutual disarmament, in which everyone's inhebitions are collectivley lowered, placing the group at an equal level of vulnerability. Alcohol being the greater leveler which facilitates honest conversations amongst peers. This effect can be particuarly strong within the corporate world, where power dynamics and heirarchy can soften in the presence of alcohol.

It is for this reason that I held a fairly strong association between drinking alcohol and the act of being sociable. This association would express itself in various settings. Take the example of attending an event in which many would be meeting new people for the first time, by collectivley drinking, the underyling social anxiety is smoothed over, and the group enters a more relaxed state with flowing conversation. The same applies to the familiar environment, such as with close friends in a pub you frequent often. Having a drink together losens everyone's inhibitions, facilitating bonding.

Throughout Dry Jan I endevoured to continue living my life just as I normally do, albeit without the alcohol. I felt this was the only way to get a true representative experience of what commiting to an alchol free lifestyle would be like. In essense I was going to be just as socable as normal; visiting pubs with friends, going to the football, going for dates at nice resteraunts with my girlfriend. I didn't want to limit what I would do just because I wouldn't be taking part in the drinking. One of the highlights of the month was attending a birthday party as a plus one it was an environment where I didn't know the majority of people, but removing the alcohol enstilled a true self of confidence where it wasn't a pre-condition in order to socialise.

> Through the process of going alcohol free you will break the mental link between alcohol and socalisation. _([Clear - James Swanwick](https://amzn.to/4a9cAWG))_.

The above quote from _Clear_ is incredibly pertinant to my experience over the month. I came to realise that you really don't need alcohol to be socialble, and honestly, if you're with the right kind of company, nobody even cares that you're not having an alcholic drink. Besides, the alcohol free beers look identical to the eye. If they do care, that's a big sign that they don't want to be the only one poisioning themselves and are best to be avoided.

> You're never ging to get far when you need a crutch to move forward... You might believe the iquor makes it eaiser to be yourself, but you also need the confidence that you can do it without them. Otherwise you're never going to be in control of your own situation.... No matter what situation or setting you find yourself in, you don't want to depend on anything to make you feel in control and comfortabkle. That confidence should come from within. Not an external source.

Breaking this link gives me hope for the survival of the pub. It's a fact that younger people in the UK are drinking less than their parents did, this could be for health reasons, it could be for the price. Despite my views on British binge drinking culture, I do see the pub is a very important institution and a pillar of the community within British life. I want the pubs to continue to operate, which is proving difficult under the constant anti-hospitality measures, minimum wage increases and poor energy policy the government keeps perusing, contributing to the lack of competitivness of the sector. The pub is one of the few _third spaces_ we have and is vital for the mental wellbeing of our people. In particular, i love exploring the various pubs within the City of London and soaking up the history in these places. Why does it give me hope? I feel the pubs can evolve with the times and place less emphaiss on the presence of alcohol. Going to the pub shouldn't have to be about alcohol, its about the connections between people, which can happen over any drink, be it alcoholic or not.
