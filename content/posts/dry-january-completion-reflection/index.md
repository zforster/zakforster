+++

At the start of the year, I set myself the objective of completing _Dry January_, the modern phenomenon of abstaining from alcohol for the first month of the year. This decision was experimental, conducted to determine if the claims reported by those who live an alcohol free lifestyle were true. Notably, improved energy levels, better sleep, enhanced mental clarity, and improved consistency of output.

As the month progressed, I found the changes resulting from this experiment compelling. Enjoying this newly found lifestyle, I chose to extend the experiment on into February. As I write this, it is February the 19th, and today I will complete my 50th day alcohol free. In this blog, I will discuss my reasons for starting this journey, reflect on my experiences so far, share my renewed perspective on alcohol, and detail why I'm excited to continue this experiment on.

### Why I Decided to Stop Drinking

#### Protecting Valuable Free Time

In recent years, as I've hit my mid-to-late twenties, the volume of alcohol I consume has naturally declined. Changing circumstances, primarily driven by positive career developments, constrained the amount of free time that I have. As a result, I place far greater value on the limited free time that I do have, and chose selectively how to spend it. I want to protect my fleeting free time and make the most of it. Alcohol isn't compatible with this objective; it leads to wasted time spent in a state of self-inflicted misery via the hangover.

Entering into 2026, I was already in a mental state that was questioning the norms around drinking, one in which I would restrict the volume of alcohol I would consume, or quite happily go without it, often choosing to drink the alcohol free options as a substitute. I could see that cutting alcohol out completely was the logical progression given this objective to make the most of my free time.

#### Prioritising Energy and Focus

I recently read two books that have influenced my renewed perspective on alcohol consumption: [Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter by 50 Cent](https://amzn.to/4bpsz5o) and [Clear by James Swanwick](https://amzn.to/4a9cAWG). In reading 50 Cent's book, I was suprised to learn that despite his public persona, Curtis largely abstains from alcohol and other vices. Instead, he gets his energy from working out and living a clean lifestyle. He states that this clean lifestyle provides him with the energy to perform consistently. No opportunity is missed due to the impacts of alcohol.

> You have to commit to lifestyle choices that allow you to have the energy, focus, and stamina to actually do the work. _([50 Cent - Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter](https://amzn.to/4bpsz5o))_.

This is something that resonates with me, particuarly as I suffer badly after consuming relativley small volumes of alcohol. Beyond the three drink mark, I degrade the following day. I become groggy, irritable and lethargic. Everything suffers the day after drinking, from the quality of my training sessions, to the quality of sleep I get, and to the cleanliness of my diet. Focus and mental capacity becomes lackluster, diminishing my ability to tackle problems with the energy, creativity, and concentration that is required to perform at optimal levels.

Feeling this way makes it impossible to operate at maximum potential. The true cost of drinking isn't the immediate money spent on the drinks, but the longer term opportunity cost caused by reduced performance.

#### Challenging Social Norms

In Britain, we as a collective have a particuarly unhealthy relationship with alcohol. We have a huge binge drinking culture, and as a nation we drink to excess. It just so happens that we also have a huge pub culture. This in itself isn't inherently problematic; the pub serves a valid purpose as a vital community third space. At times however, the line between pub culture and binge drinking culture become blurred. I have a unique perspective on this topic; I happen to live opposite a pub, which provides ample opportunities to observe human nature when under the influence of alcohol. From my birds eye vantage, you see how alcohol can induce emotions of happiness and community, to explosions of anger and envy, resulting in poor decisions and regret.

I grew up in the UK, and in my late teens and early twenties, going out with the objective of getting as drunk as possible was the unquestioned norm, particuarly at university. It is so engrained in the culture, that not taking part is very difficult to do, especially when you're young and impressionable. We are all sensitive to the opinions of our peers, and going against the grain marks you out as an oddity, which is an uncomfortable feeling as wanting to conform to the norms of the group is so ingrained in us.

Adding to the pressure to drink that comes from our peers, we also have cultural programming to contend with:

> Cultural conditioning has led us to believe that alcohol is important and a normal part of our lifestyle. Movies, TV, and commercials paint alcohol as glamorous, fun and an essential part of a life well lived. _([Clear - James Swanwick](https://amzn.to/4a9cAWG))_.

After reading _Clear_, I began to see the societal conditioning around me. Look at any advertisement for an alcoholic drink. In almost all cases, the drink is at the center of some event taking place on a beach or a colourful city, filled with happy people having a great time socialising. They sell the idea that drinking is **the central activity** that binds people together in a social setting, projecting the image that you can't be social without having a drink.

Going alcohol free was my attempt to reset the way in which I view societies relationship with alcohol, and in a small way rebelling against the norms.

### What I Gained Going Alcohol Free

Many online claim their experiences of alcohol free living have been life changing. I wouldn't go that far, at least not yet. But there certainly have been improvements to my life that I attribute to the fact I've had a period of time without drinking.

#### Improved Energy Levels

The most notably change has been in my energy levels. When I was drinking, it would be commonplace to require a nap, particuarly after work, or in the mid-afternoon on a weekend. It was never something I questioned, I put it down to needing a little more recouporation than the rest of us, which would fit with the active lifestyle I live.

After going alcohol free, I now realise that the root of this problem was in fact a knock on effect from the evenings I did have a drink. Alcohol is very detremental to sleep. It is particuarly damaging to REM sleep, which is crucial for memory consolidation and emotional regulation. So in all likelihood, my napping habits were a response from my body to poor quality sleep.

My natural energy levels are much higher without the impacts of alcohol. I still feel the need to nap from time-to-time, particuarly after hard Jiu-Jitsu sessions, but the frequency of this is much lower and the intra-day tiredness is gone.

#### Clarity of Thought

The accumulated impact of poor sleep, inflamation, and dehydration associated with drinking alcohol sometimes leads to _brain fog_; a temporary state of mental impairment in which you struggle to concentrate, think clearly, or remember information.

When I did drink, I would feel this most acutely on Fridays, particuarly when I worked in [the City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London), frequenting areas such as Moorgate, Bank, Broadgate, and Leadenhall Market on _Thirsty Thursdays_. On those Fridays, I would find myself feeling very tired, struggling to engage with my task, and catch myself longing to go home and sleep.

It has been many Fridays since I last felt that way, and I much prefer it. I'm able to feel sharp and alert, ready to take on any challenge that may come my way.

#### Understanding True Confidence

Throughout this expeiment, I have continued living my social life as I normally do. I haven't limited the type of environment I would go to, or who I would see, just because I wouldn't be taking part in the drinking. I've still visited pubs, attended football games, and gone to nice resteraunts, all places I would previously have drunk at, and still had a very enjoyable time. This has further helped to decouple any association between alcohol and socialisation that I may have held. To avoid these types of activities and shell up because you wont be drinking would be very dangerous as you will resent the lifestyle; you need to experience life as you normally would to fully appreciate the benefits of sobriety.

After experiencing life without alcohol, you being to realise that you don't need it to be socialble, and question all the situations in which you've relied on alcohol to project confidence. In the absense of the default fallback, you undestand what true confidence is, and that is the confidence that comes not from external sources, but from yourself.

That sense of confidence should always come from within. Not from an external source. _([50 Cent - Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter](https://amzn.to/4bpsz5o))_.

### Will I Continue This Experiment?

For now yes! I'm not going to be foolish enough to say I'll never drink again, I may well do, but I may also not do. I really do not know. I do know however, that during this peroid, I have enjoyed the consistency, energy and clarity I've experienced. I like the fact I wake up feeling the same everyday. I haven't missed drinking, or feel I've lost anything from my life (except hangovers). I've only gained things. For now, I'm excited to continue this on and see where this goes. Thanks for reading!
