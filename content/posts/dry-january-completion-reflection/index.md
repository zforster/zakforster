+++

At the start of the year, I set myself the objective of completing _Dry January_, the modern phenomenon of abstaining from alcohol for the entire month of January. I did this to reset my perspective on alcohol consumption and see if I experienced the benefits many who live an alcohol free lifestyle frequently share online. As I write this it is the 1st of February 2026, and I have successfully completed 31 days without consuming any alcohol.

In this blog I describe my motivations for partaking in Dry Jan, reflecting on my experiences and present my renewed views on alcohol. I'll conclude by presenting my views as to if I will be continuing this on beyond the month of Janurary.

## Lifestyle Changes

There were various factors in my decision to partake in dry Jan. Over the course of the last couple of years, particuarly as I hit my mid to late twenties I have slowly been reducing the volume of alcohol I consume. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the odd pint with friends, but alcohol simply isn't a big part of my lifestyle annymore like it was during my university years. Already prior to partaking in dry janurary, I had begun to flirt with the idea of going alcohol free for a period of time, managing tweleve consequtive days in 2025. Entering into 2026 I could already quite happily go without any alcohol, often choosing to drink alcohol free beers on an evening out. It therefore seemed a natural progression to cut it out completley.

## Performance Degredation

I recently read 50 Cent's Book [Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Untitled-Curtis-34/dp/006295380X). I was suprised to learn that despite his public persona and the image he portrays through his music, 50 Cent largely abstains from alcohol and other vices. Instead he gets his energy from working out and living a clean lifestyle. He states:

> You have to commit to lifestyle choices that allow you to have the energy, focus, and stamina to actually do the work

Living this clean lifestyle provides him with the energy to perform consistently. He never missing any meeting, gym session or opportunity because he has had too much to drink the previous night.

This is something that resonates deeply with me. I generally feel I am pre-disposed to sugger more when I have consumed alcohol than the average person. I'd rarley exceed three drinks on an evening out, the reason for that is that is around the limit where I begin to seriously degrade the following day. I feel tired and groggy after a poor nights sleep and feel generally miserable. I'm often tired without the alcohol, so introducing alcohol compounds that problem. I'd identified that alcohol was a cause of this issue. Why would you want to spend your life feeling that way?

I also don't get a lot of free time. I use an app called HabitKit to track my habits, and through this I realised I spent almost 10% of my year in some state of hangover. This made me question if alcohol is worth drinking, if it results in wasting precious free time feeling ill.My answer is that it simply isn't.

When you're feeling the impacts of alcohol the following day, it is impossible to operate at 100%. Feeling less mentally sharp, less energetic, you are less able to make optimal decisions, your performance in all aspects of life is degraded substantially by the presence of alcohol. Often I would go out on a Thursday evening in the City of London, have a few pints and wake up feeling poor the following day, degrading my performance on a Friday. I want to be able to perform at my best in all situtations.

> There's a snowball effect that over the years, adds up to huge losses in performance, success, buisness revenue, personal income, happiness, and fulfilement

opportunity cost beyond the cash spent. Its the money you dont make because youre tired / lack of sleep.

Drinkins leads to fatigue and brain fog, reducing the overall quality of your work.

## Societal Conditioning and Impacts

As a culture we are encouraged to drink. As James Swanswick highlights in his book [Clear](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clear-Neuroscience-Based-Achievers-Drinking-Willpower/dp/B0F2WJD116)

> Cultural conditioning has led us to believe that alcohol is important and a normal part of our lifestyle... Movies, TV,] commercials paint alcohol as glamorous, fund and an essential part of a life well lived.

His argumennt being that we are being programmed to believe alcohol is sophisticated and necessesary for a good time. From the adverts showing scenic beaches, colourful citices and fun events. They sell the idea their products are a requirement for a good time.

What they don't show however is the damage alcohol does to society. In Britain we have a particuarly childish relationship with alcohol and a huge binge drinking culture. In contras to our mediteranian peers, we as a nation drink to excess to the detriment of our public services. Weirdly the volume of poison we can consume as a nation seems to be something of a point of national pride. When people drink, they become stupid and do things they wouldn't normally do. They do things they wouldn't normally do, getting into un-necessary fights and arguments. I see alot of this first hand, I live opposite a pub. I don't want to partake in it, it just irritates me.

## True Confidence

> You're never ging to get far when you need a crutch to move forward... You might believe the iquor makes it eaiser to be yourself, but you also need the confidence that you can do it without them. Otherwise you're never going to be in control of your own situation.... No matter what situation or setting you find yourself in, you don't want to depend on anything to make you feel in control and comfortabkle. That confidence should come from within. Not an external source.

> Through the process of going alcohol free you will break the mental link between alcohol and socalisation.

> If you need alcohol to be around a certain person or group, it's a sign that you dont want to be around them.

> When others try to make you drink, its because they dont want to be the only one poisiong themselves.

> Nobody cares if you don't drink.

## Tips to continue

- be socialble still. dont isolate yourself.

- Change your internal language. Instead of saying I have to, which implies hard work and force. You get to. Say you;re looking forward to gaining a clearer mind tomorrow morning. See the gains, not the negatives.

You have to change your internal mindset. The environment around you will be unchanged.
