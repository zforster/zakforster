+++

At the start of the year, I set myself the objective of completing _Dry January_, the modern phenomenon of abstaining from alcohol for the entire month of January. I did this for a variety of reasons, primarily out of curiosity, to see if I experienced the multitude of benefits many who live an alcohol free lifestyle report online, notably improved energy levels, better sleep, enhanced mental clarity, and improved consistency of output.

Finding the changes in that month compelling, I chose to extend this experiment beyond its original scope and on into Feburary. As I write this, it is February 9th; today I will complete my 40th day alcohol free. In this blog, I want to reflect on my experiences over that peroid of time, share my renewed perspective on alcohol, and why I'm excited to conitnue this experiment on potentially indefinatley.

### My Reasons for Doing Dry January

#### Evolving Lifestyle and Drinking Habits

Over recent years, as I've hit my mid-to-late twenties, the volume of alcohol I consume has naturally declined. Alcohol simply isn't a big part of my lifestyle. Changing circumstances, primarily driven by positive career developments, involving more responsibilites and longer working hours, placed constraints on the amount of free time I have. As a result, I place far greater value on the limited free time that I do have, and chose selectivley how to spend it. I want to protect my free time and make the most of it. Wasting it in a state of self-inflicted misery caused by too many drinks the previous evening is at odds with this objective.

Entering into 2026, I was already in a place where I would restrict the volume of alcohol I would consume, or quite happily go without any alcohol on an evening out. Finding as much joy in the alcohol free options.

It therefore seemed a natural progression, and a relativley easy one, to commit to cut it out completley for the month, with the goal of evaluating if it was something I wanted to continue on past Janurary.

#### Prioritising Energy and Focus

I recently read 50 Cent's Book [Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter](https://amzn.to/4bpsz5o). I was suprised to learn that despite his public persona, 50 Cent largely abstains from alcohol and other vices. Instead he gets his energy from working out and living a clean lifestyle. He states that living this clean lifestyle provides him with the energy to perform consistently, never missing an opportunity because of alcohol consumption the previous night.

This is something that resonates with me, particuarly as I suffer badly after consuming relativley small volumes of alcohol. Beyond the three drink mark, I seriously degrade the following day. I'm groggy, un-energetic, irritable, lathargic and generally in a miserable state. The quality of my training is reduced. The lack of sleep causes me to eat poor quality, highly calorific foods. My focus and mental capacity becomes lackluster, diminishing my ability to tackle problems with energy, creativity and concentration.

Feeling this way makes it impossible for me to operate at my maximum potential. I have come to realise that the cost of drinking goes beyond the monetary value spent on purchasing the drinks. There's a wider opportunity cost caused by the performance lag.

#### Questioning Societal Norms

In Britain, we have a particuarly unhealthy relationship with alcohol. We have a huge binge drinking culture, and as a nation we drink to excess. Unbeknownst to me, our ability to collectivley consume large volumes of poision is seen as a point of national pride. Growing up in the UK, going out with the sole objective of getting as trashed as you can is a rite of passage. It is so engrained in the culture, that not taking part is very difficult to do, especially for a young and impressionable person who's very sensitive to the opinions of their peers. Going against the grain singels you out as an oddity, which is an uncomfortable feeling. Following the trends of the tribe is deeply engrained in our nature through evolutionary pressures.

On top of the pressure to drink that comes from being within a group of peers all doing so, we also have cultural programming to contend with. This conditioning further reinforces the messaging that alcohol consumption is normal, and a required item for a whole range of events.

After reading Clear, I began to see alcohol advertisement in a new light. Look at any advertisement for an alcoholic drink. In almost all cases, the alcoholic drink is at the center of some event taking place on a scenic beach or colourful city, filled with smiling and happy people having a great time socialising with eachother. They sell the idea that drinking is literally the central pivotal thing that binds people together in a social setting, projecting the image that you can't posibbly talk to your friends without having a drink.

</div>

_Ads from Corona and Guinness, both selling the idea that drinking is central to a good time with friends._

The more I see these ads, the more they being to irritate me. They're not telling the full story. I feel I have a unique perspective here as I live opposite a pub and I can confidently say based on that experience that when people drink to excess, they become stupid. They do things they wouldn't normally do if they were not under the influence of alcohol. They become loud, impulsive, anti-social and annoying to be around to the sober individual. They get into fights and arguments that they wouldn't have gotten into without the alcohol to the detriment of the public services that have to come clean up the mess.

I guess you could say that by taking part in Dry Jan, was my way of rebelling against this societal norm.

### What I Gained Going Alcohol Free

#### Improved Energy Levels

Not drinking enhanced my energy levels. When I was drinking, it wouldn't be uncommon for me to take a nap in the evening after work, or in the mid-afternoon on a weekend. I never thought much of this, putting it down to the fact I just needed a little bit more rest than the rest of us.

After going alcohol free, I now realise that the root of this problem was in fact a knock on effect from the evenings I did have a drink. Alcohol is very detremental to sleep. It is particuarly ruthless against your restorative REM sleep. So in all likelihood, my napping requirements was most likely my bodies attempt to catch up on lost, or poor quality sleep.

My natural energy levels are much higher post going alcohol free, very rarley have I felt the need for a nap over this month. I put this down to having more restorative and deeper sleep, with full amounts of REM sleep now that the interrupting mechanisms of alcohol are gone.

#### Consistency

#### True Confidence

For all the criticisms I have levied towards alcohol throughout this article, I do feel alcohol serves a perfectly legitimate purpose within social settings. My theory is that groups of individuals gravitate towards consuming alcoholic drinks together as a form of mutual disarmament, in which everyone's inhebitions are collectivley lowered, placing the group at an equal level of vulnerability. Alcohol being the greater leveler which facilitates honest conversations amongst peers.

This is one of the reasons there is a strong association between being sociable and drinking. This association would express itself in various settings. Take the example of attending an event in which many would be meeting new people for the first time, by collectivley drinking, the underyling social anxiety is smoothed over, and the group enters a more relaxed state with flowing conversation. The same applies to the familiar environment, such as with close friends in a pub you frequent often. Having a drink together losens everyone's inhibitions, facilitating bonding.

Throughout Dry Jan I continued living my social life as I normally do; visiting pubs with friends, going to the football, going for dates at nice resteraunts with my girlfriend. I didn't limit where I would go just because I wouldn't be taking part in the drinking.

After a month of experiencing life without the alcohol, you being to realise that you don't need it to be socialble and question all the times you've relied on alcohol to project confidence. Besides, if you're with the right kind of company, nobody cares that you're not having an alcholic drink. Besides, the alcohol free beers look identical to the eye. Breaking this link between drinking and being social begins to bring out your true confidence.

> No matter what situation or setting you find yourself in, you don’t ever want to depend on anything—or any other person—to make you feel in control and comfortable. That sense of confidence should always come from within. Not from an external source. _([50 Cent - Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter](https://amzn.to/4bpsz5o))_.
