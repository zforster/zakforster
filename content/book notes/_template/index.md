## 🚀 What’s the Big Idea?

A quick snapshot of the book’s core concept or purpose — not just what it says, but what it’s really about.

## 🤷‍♂️ Who Should Read This?

Still great — keep it. Maybe include reader types, situations, or even who shouldn’t bother.

## 💡 My Key Takeaways

Also great. Your main insights, lessons, or aha moments.

## 🧠 Things That Made Me Think

Unexpected moments, quotes, or arguments that shifted your perspective or made you pause.

## 🔥 Lines That Hit Hard

A short collection of powerful, funny, or memorable quotes — what stuck with you the most.

## 😬 I Wasn’t Expecting That

Surprising twists, disappointments, or bold claims the book made that caught you off guard.

## ✅ How I’m Actually Using This

Practical changes you've made (or plan to) based on the book. Even better if it's honest: “Tried this. Totally works.” or “Nice idea, but nope.”
